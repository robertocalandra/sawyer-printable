# sawyer-printable
This repository contain 3D-printable model of fingers for the Sawyer/Baxter


## 4-hole mount
This model is a basic 4-hole mounting connector for the Sawyer/Baxter gripper


## Sawyer's Finger
This model is a simple finger for the Sawyer/Baxter gripper. 
Compared to the default gripper, this one is slightly longer and wider, resulting in better grasping capabilities.

For best grip we suggest to glue a non-slip surface, such as [this](https://www.amazon.com/SoftTouch-Self-Stick-Non-Slip-Surface-Grip/dp/B000SL0KJC).

For best printing we suggest to rotate the model 90 degrees to lie flat on the ground.
