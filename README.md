## 4-hole mount
<img src="http://www.robertocalandra.com/wp-content/uploads/github/mount_sawyer.png" height="200">

Basic 4-hole mounting connector for the Sawyer/Baxter gripper, which can be used as base for any kind of end-effector. 
Can use both the original screws from Rethink or standard M4x12mm screws, such as [these](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-M4x12mm-Socket-Knurled-Screws/dp/B011BNR6HE).


## Sawyer's Finger
<img src="http://www.robertocalandra.com/wp-content/uploads/github/finger_sawyer.png" height="200">

Simple finger for the Sawyer/Baxter gripper. Compared to the default fingers, this one is slightly longer and wider, resulting in better grasping capabilities.
For the best grip we suggest to glue a non-slip surface, such as [this](https://www.amazon.com/SoftTouch-Self-Stick-Non-Slip-Surface-Grip/dp/B000SL0KJC).
For the best 3D-printing we suggest to rotate the model 90 degrees to lie flat on the ground.
Can use both the original screws from Rethink or standard M4x12mm screws, such as [these](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-M4x12mm-Socket-Knurled-Screws/dp/B011BNR6HE).

Example with two fingers grasping a cup.
