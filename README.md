## Sawyer's Finger
<img src="http://www.robertocalandra.com/wp-content/uploads/github/finger_sawyer.png" height="200">
Simple finger for the Sawyer/Baxter gripper. Compared to the default fingers, this one is slightly longer and wider, resulting in better grasping capabilities.
For the best grip we suggest to glue a non-slip surface, such as [this](https://www.amazon.com/SoftTouch-Self-Stick-Non-Slip-Surface-Grip/dp/B000SL0KJC).
For the best 3D-printing we suggest to rotate the model 90 degrees to lie flat on the ground.

Here are two of the fingers used to grasp a cup.
