## connector_sawyer.stl
<img src="http://www.robertocalandra.com/wp-content/uploads/github/connector_sawyer.png" height="200">

Basic 4-hole mounting connector for the Sawyer/Baxter gripper, which can be used as base for any kind of end-effector. 
Can use both the original screws from Rethink, or standard M4x12mm screws, such as [these](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-M4x12mm-Socket-Knurled-Screws/dp/B011BNR6HE).


## finger_sawyer.stl
<img src="http://www.robertocalandra.com/wp-content/uploads/github/finger_sawyer.png" height="200">

Simple finger for the Sawyer/Baxter gripper. Compared to the default fingers, this one is slightly longer and wider, resulting in better grasping capabilities.
For the best grip we suggest to glue a non-slip surface, such as [this](https://www.amazon.com/SoftTouch-Self-Stick-Non-Slip-Surface-Grip/dp/B000SL0KJC).
For the best 3D-printing we suggest to rotate the model 90 degrees to lie flat on the ground.
The finger can use both the original screws from Rethink, or standard M4x12mm screws, such as [these](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-M4x12mm-Socket-Knurled-Screws/dp/B011BNR6HE).

Example with two fingers grasping a cup.
